# SageMaker Deployment Project

This notebook and associated files form the deployment project which was part of the udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree.

We use AWS to deploy a sentiment analysis model which is able to take in user input through a simple web-app and send it through to a endpoint created in AWS for inference, then return a prediction to the user.

The model architecture used in this project is an LSTM (RNN).
